# Variant 1:
# We just want to find value of DHF statistics for series u 
# and adequate critical value:

# including seasonal dummies:
DHF_test(d_QNC, 0, 1, 0.1, 1)

# including constant, without seasonal dummies:
DHF_test(d_QNC, 1, 0, 0.1, 1)

# without constant and without seasonal dummies:
DHF_test(d_QNC, 0, 0, 0.1, 1)

# Variant 2:
# We want to know if we should reject H0 (1) or not reject (0)
# including seasonal dummies:
printf "Do we reject H0?\t%d\n", DHF_test(d_QNC,0,1,0.1,1)
# we get 0: do not reject H0 - there is seasonal unit root

# including constant, without seasonal dummies:
printf "Do we reject H0?\t%d\n", DHF_test(d_QNC,1,0,0.1,1)
# we get 1: we reject H0 - there is not seasonal unit root

# without constant and without seasonal dummies:
printf "Do we reject H0?\t%d\n", DHF_test(d_QNC,0,0,0.1,1)
# we get 1: we reject H0 - there is not seasonal unit-root
