# If we want to replicate results of Dickey's Natural Gas exmaple we just
# have to run DST_test package with following parameters. We then can see t-statistic
# -25.14 (which is slightly higher than Dickey's -26.25), value of this statistic
# corrected to N(0,1) and its p-value.
DST_test(Total, 2, 1, DET, 52, 1)

# If we just want to know p-value, we can run the procedure like this:
printf "p-val: %f\n", DST_test(Total, 2, 1, DET, 52, 0)

# In the above examples we filtered the series by AR(2) filter. If we don't know which exactly
# AR(p) filter to use, however we know that p should be i.e. 1<= p <= 10, then we can run
# the procedure as below. All possible ARIMA(p,0,0) models will be estimated and for further
# analysis specification with the lowest BIC criterion will we selected (this order will be
# printed in summary).
DST_test(Total, 10, 0, DET, 52, 1)

# List of deterministic elements is not mandatory, so we can run the procedure with "null":
